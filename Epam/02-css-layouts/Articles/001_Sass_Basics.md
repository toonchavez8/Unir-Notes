# Sass Basics

Before you can use Sass, you need to set it up on your project. If you want to just browse here, go ahead, but we recommend you go install Sass first.Â [Go here](https://sass-lang.com/install)Â if you want to learn how to get everything setÂ up.

## [Preprocessing](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#preprocessing)

CSSÂ on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass has features that donâ€™t exist inÂ CSSÂ yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainableÂ CSS.

Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normalÂ CSSÂ file that you can use in yourÂ website.

The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass toÂ CSSÂ using theÂ `sass`Â command. Youâ€™ll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to outputÂ CSSÂ to. For example, runningÂ `sass input.scss output.css`Â from your terminal would take a single Sass file,Â `input.scss`, and compile that file toÂ `output.css`.

You can also watch individual files or directories with theÂ `--watch`Â flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compileÂ CSSÂ each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) yourÂ `input.scss`Â file, youâ€™d just add the watch flag to your command, likeÂ so:

```shellsession
sass --watch input.scss output.css
```

You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In thisÂ example:

```shellsession
sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets
```

Sass would watch all files in theÂ `app/sass`Â folder for changes, and compileÂ CSSÂ to theÂ `public/stylesheets`Â folder.

> [!important]
> ### ðŸ’¡ Fun fact:
> Sass has two syntaxes! TheÂ SCSSÂ syntax (`.scss`) is used most commonly. Itâ€™s a superset ofÂ CSS, which means all validÂ CSSÂ is also validÂ SCSS. The indented syntax (`.sass`) is more unusual: it uses indentation rather than curly braces to nest statements, and newlines instead of semicolons to separate them. All our examples are available in bothÂ syntaxes.

## [Nesting](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#nesting)

When writingÂ HTMLÂ youâ€™ve probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy.Â CSS, on the other hand,Â doesnâ€™t.

Sass will let you nest yourÂ CSSÂ selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of yourÂ HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualifiedÂ CSSÂ that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered badÂ practice.

With that in mind, hereâ€™s an example of some typical styles for a siteâ€™sÂ navigation:

```sCSS
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```

Youâ€™ll notice that theÂ `ul`,Â `li`, andÂ `a`Â selectors are nested inside theÂ `nav`Â selector. This is a great way to organize yourÂ CSSÂ and make it moreÂ readable.

This will turn into the following CSS

```css
nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}
nav a {
  display: block;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

## [Partials](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#partials)

You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets ofÂ CSSÂ that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize yourÂ CSSÂ and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something likeÂ `_partial.scss`. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into aÂ CSSÂ file. Sass partials are used with theÂ `@use`Â rule.

---

## Modules

You donâ€™t have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want with theÂ `@use`Â rule. This rule loads another Sass file as aÂ _module_, which means you can refer to its variables,Â [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#mixins), andÂ [functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/function)Â in your Sass file with a namespace based on the filename. Using a file will also include theÂ CSSÂ it generates in your compiledÂ output!

For example 

```scss
// _base.scss
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
```

```scss
// styles.scss
@use 'base';

.inverse {
  background-color: base.$primary-color;
  color: white;
}
```

Notice weâ€™re usingÂ `@use 'base';`Â in theÂ `styles.scss`Â file. When you use a file you donâ€™t need to include the file extension. Sass is smart and will figure it out forÂ you.

These two will output the following in the main css style

```css
body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}

.inverse {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}

```

## Mixins

Some things inÂ CSSÂ are a bit tedious to write, especially withÂ CSS3Â and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make groups ofÂ CSSÂ declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. It helps keep your Sass veryÂ DRY. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. Hereâ€™s an example forÂ `theme`.

```scss
@mixin theme($theme: DarkGray) {
  background: $theme;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba($theme, .25);
  color: #fff;
}

.info {
  @include theme;
}
.alert {
  @include theme($theme: DarkRed);
}
.success {
  @include theme($theme: DarkGreen);
}
```

To create a mixin you use theÂ `@mixin`Â directive and give it a name. Weâ€™ve named our mixinÂ `theme`. Weâ€™re also using the variableÂ `$theme`Â inside the parentheses so we can pass in aÂ `theme`Â of whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it as aÂ CSSÂ declaration starting withÂ `@include`Â followed by the name of theÂ mixin.

```css
.info {
  background: DarkGray;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(169, 169, 169, 0.25);
  color: #fff;
}

.alert {
  background: DarkRed;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(139, 0, 0, 0.25);
  color: #fff;
}

.success {
  background: DarkGreen;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 100, 0, 0.25);
  color: #fff;
}
```

## Extend/Inheritance

UsingÂ `@extend`Â lets you share a set ofÂ CSSÂ properties from one selector to another. In our example weâ€™re going to create a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes using another feature which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when it is extended, and can help keep your compiledÂ CSSÂ neat andÂ clean.

```scss
/* This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. */
%message-shared {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

// This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never extended.
%equal-heights {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.message {
  @extend %message-shared;
}

.success {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: yellow;
}
```

What the above code does is tellsÂ `.message`,Â `.success`,Â `.error`, andÂ `.warning`Â to behave just likeÂ `%message-shared`. That means anywhere thatÂ `%message-shared`Â shows up,Â `.message`,Â `.success`,Â `.error`,Â &Â `.warning`Â will too. The magic happens in the generatedÂ CSS, where each of these classes will get the sameÂ CSSÂ properties asÂ `%message-shared`. This helps you avoid having to write multiple class names onÂ HTMLÂ elements.

You can extend most simpleÂ CSSÂ selectors in addition to placeholder classes in Sass, but using placeholders is the easiest way to make sure you arenâ€™t extending a class thatâ€™s nested elsewhere in your styles, which can result in unintended selectors in yourÂ CSS.

Note that theÂ CSSÂ inÂ `%equal-heights`Â isnâ€™t generated, becauseÂ `%equal-heights`Â is neverÂ extended.

```css
/* This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. */
.warning, .error, .success, .message {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

.success {
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  border-color: yellow;
}
```

## Operators

Doing math in yourÂ CSSÂ is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators likeÂ `+`,Â `-`,Â `*`,Â `math.div()`, andÂ `%`. In our example weâ€™re going to do some simple math to calculate widths for anÂ `article`Â andÂ `aside`.

```scss
@use "sass:math";

.container {
  display: flex;
}

article[role="main"] {
  width: math.div(600px, 960px) * 100%;
}

aside[role="complementary"] {
  width: math.div(300px, 960px) * 100%;
  margin-left: auto;
}
```

Weâ€™ve created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations in Sass let us do something like take pixel values and convert them to percentages without muchÂ hassle.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

article[role=main] {
  width: 62.5%;
}

aside[role=complementary] {
  width: 31.25%;
  margin-left: auto;
}
```
